(##) RENDERED IMAGE FINAL

Your image:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A3-writeup/student/cowparentstriedhidingtheircowsonbuttheyaremadeofglassandmirrorsandsoarethewallssoyoucanstillseetheirson.png" alt="Cow Parents tried hiding their Cow Son but they are made of glass and mirrors and so are the walls so you can still see their son">
</div>
Explanation of what it is and how you made it:
I wanted to emphasize the mirror and glass materials because I spent so long making them so it's a scene of a cow family where one parent is made of glass and the other is made of mirrors and their son is lambertian. I thought it would be funny to have them try to hide their son when they're made of glass and mirrors. Also added mirror walls to really make it impossible for them to obscure their son. :)
